Okay, so, I just got out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 G20 and... wow, I'm not sure if my brain is fried from the   or if it's just my lack of caffeine. Maybe both. You know those moments where you're kind of baffled and can't tell if you enjoyed the thing or are just relieved it's over? That's me right now. 

Firstly, what's up with the chaos? I mean, sure, G20 is about global politics — heard of them? — but cramming everything into two hours felt like they dumped all their Google searches onto the script. Who thought that was a good idea? Or maybe I’m missing something, wouldn’t be the first time.

The opening scene, with its screeching string instruments, felt like trying to calm a tantruming toddler with a bag of flaming popcorn. Seriously, it's like the director said, Let's make this more confusing so nobody questions the plot holes. At least the acting had some meat to it — some of the cast literally carried scenes on their weary shoulders. Kudos to them for surviving that jungle gym of a narrative. 

>Sidenote: whoever decided to put in those random slow-motion shots should be made to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 them on loop. Forever. They reminded me of someone's Instagram reels when they think they're cinematic geniuses. But hey, maybe people will still 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just for that?. I guess incomplete effects become an art form or something.

There was this part that seemed out of place, a diplomatic standoff laced with bad jokes that sounded like they were written by a sleep-deprived intern. It was kind of like mixing Shakespeare with Tabasco sauce — unexpected, with a side of confusion and a sprinkle of the absurd? I snorted at some lines, not sure if it was out of actual humor or pure bewilderment. Ever had those laugh-so-you-don’t-cry moments? Yeah. That.

I remember, about halfway through, my seat creaked ominously. For a second, I wasn't sure what was collapsing — the chair or my patience. It's like, is the exhaustion from figuring out what on Earth was going on or from having to process two and a half hours of cinematic gymnastics? Whatever it was, it left me feeling like I hiked Mount Everest but mentally and while sitting. A paradox, if I've ever seen one.

    return diplomacy > 0 ? nations[diplomacy] : -1;
}

As I walked out, I overheard people talking about grabbing a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 of the   later. Maybe it's one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 that makes more sense on the second 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Or after a nap. Or after a few drinks? Not sure. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Sure, maybe, if I was in the mood for a messy kind of brilliance. Like abstract art that your cat accidentally painted.

So yeah, that was G20, where the world is on fire and you're half-tempted to pull up a chair and just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it burn in cinematic style. But for now, I think I'll 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a rerun of something light and fluffy, just to remind myself that not everything needs intricate political entanglements to be entertaining.
